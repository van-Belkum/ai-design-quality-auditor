# ---- Starter rules for the Design QA app ----
# Everything here is editable in-app via the "Rules" expander or by uploading a CSV.
# Top-level sections the app understands:
# - required_phrases: phrases that MUST appear anywhere in the PDF (or on specific pages via "page_contains")
# - forbidden_pairs: if left contains any of the words and right contains any, raise a finding.
# - suppress_patterns: messages (substring match) the app should ignore (learned as "Not valid").
# - meta: optional picklist defaults for the left-side metadata form.
